<h1>Description</h1>
This Simon Game is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to create an interactive memory-based challenge. The game generates random sequences of button flashes and sounds that the player must replicate. As the player progresses, the sequence grows longer, and the game becomes more difficult.
<p></p>
The HTML defines the game layout, including the buttons and title. CSS styles the game with vibrant colors, shadow effects, and smooth transitions, giving it a polished and responsive design. The game also incorporates animations and background music for a dynamic user experience.
<p></p>
JavaScript handles game logic, including generating sequences, checking user input, and progressing through levels. User interactions are managed through event listeners, with the jQuery library simplifying DOM manipulation and animations. Sound effects and visual feedback enhance the gameplay, providing an engaging and responsive experience for users.
